# cyBackup

This is a complete rewrite of the known cyBackup.

Due a lack of time im currently not actively developing this one, a working version can be donwloaded in my Repository just add [http://cytec.us](http://cytec.us) to cydia and look for cyBackup.

also [insanelyi](http://insanelyi.com) has an official copy of it.

**I hope to find some time to get back on this soon**

### Some planed features:

- Expand Script to backup more than only debs (SMS, Photos, etc)
- Dropbox upload support
- rewrite to optargs
- runtime args overwrite setting args
- move settings to plist
- support for "new" Cydia (1.x)
- iOS 5.x support
- add depends to script (not only to deb)
- improve convert function (old settings to new one)
- improve first run function (settings helper)
- may include an autoupdate?
